# Vulnerability Scanners Overview

## Task 1 - What Are Vulnerabilities?
A **vulnerability** is a weakness in software or hardware that an attacker can exploit to compromise a digital device. Much like holes in a residential roof that allow rain and pests to enter, digital vulnerabilities provide a gateway for hackers to infiltrate networks. Identifying these weaknesses is critical because, unlike physical damage, digital vulnerabilities are often invisible without dedicated hunting. The process of fixing these identified weaknesses is known as **Patching**.

## Task 2 - Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is the automated inspection of systems to identify security gaps. This is a core requirement for many regulatory compliance standards.

### Scan Categories
* **Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated:** * **Authenticated Scans** use host credentials to provide deep visibility into configurations and installed apps.
    * **Unauthenticated Scans** mimic an outside attacker with no internal access, identifying the "perimeter" threat surface.
* **Internal vs. External:**
    * **Internal Scans** are performed from inside the network to see what an attacker could do after gaining initial entry.
    * **External Scans** target public-facing assets like websites to identify vulnerabilities exposed to the open internet.

## Task 3 - Vulnerability Scanning Tools
Several industry-standard tools automate the discovery of weaknesses:

| Tool | Deployment | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nessus** | On-Premises | Widely used by enterprises; offers extensive scanning options. |
| **Qualys** | Cloud-based | Subscription-based with continuous monitoring and asset management. |
| **Nexpose** | Hybrid | Provides risk scores based on asset value and vulnerability impact. |
| **OpenVAS** | Open-Source | A comprehensive, free solution ideal for small organizations. |

## Task 4 - CVE & CVSS
To standardize how vulnerabilities are tracked and prioritized, the industry uses two main systems:

* **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** A unique identifier for a specific vulnerability (e.g., **CVE-2024-9374**). This allows security professionals to reference the exact same issue across different databases.
* **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** A numerical score from **0.0 to 10.0** that represents the severity of a vulnerability. 
    * **9.0-10.0** is considered **Critical**.
    * **7.0-8.9** is considered **High**.

## Task 5: OpenVAS Operations
OpenVAS is a powerful open-source scanner often deployed via Docker to manage its complex dependencies. 

### Technical Workflow:
1.  **System Preparation:** First, the Docker engine must be installed on the host machine.
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```
3.  **Deployment:** Run the OpenVAS container image.
```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas immauss/openvas
```
5.  **Access:** Open a browser and navigate to the local interface `https://127.0.0.1`.
7.  **Scanning:** Create a "New Task," define the target IP, and execute the scan. Once the status hits "Done," the severity results are visualized on the dashboard.

## Task 6 - Conclusion
Vulnerability management is the proactive cornerstone of a modern cybersecurity defense, shifting an organization from a reactive state to a resilient one. By utilizing automated scanners like **OpenVAS** and prioritizing risks through **CVE/CVSS** frameworks, security teams can identify and remediate weaknesses before they are exploited. Ultimately, consistent scanning and timely **patching** ensure that the digital "roof" of an organization remains secure against the evolving landscape of global cyber threats.
