# Defensive Security Intro

## Task 1 - Introduction
**Defensive Security** (also known as **Blue Teaming**) is the practice of protecting an organization’s network and data from attackers. When defensive security fails, the results are massive **data leaks** and huge **fines**.

### Real-World Examples of Failure:
* **British Airways (2018):** 400,000 customers' details leaked. Fined **£20 million**.
* **Marriott International (2020):** 334 million guest records leaked. Settled a **$52 million** lawsuit.
* **23andMe (2023):** DNA and health records of 7 million users leaked. Fined **£2.31 million**.
* **SK Telecom (2024):** Poorly configured servers leaked data of 27 million users. Fined **$97 million**.

## Task 2 - Responsibilities and Roles
Defensive security is about more than just software; it involves specific **responsibilities** and a team of **experts**.

### Key Responsibilities:
* **Monitoring and Detecting:** Watching the network for **suspicious behavior** (like a login from a different country).
* **Incident Response:** Quickly **containing** and removing a threat when an alert is raised.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Learning about **attackers' methods** to stay one step ahead.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Finding and **fixing flaws** in software before hackers find them.

### Meet the Team:
* **SOC Analyst (Bob):** The **frontline** monitor who identifies suspicious behavior.
* **Incident Responder (Aaliyah):** The person who **investigates** and stops ongoing attacks.
* **Security Engineer (Zoe):** The person who builds and **maintains the tools** for the team.
* **Digital Forensics (Bill):** The expert who analyzes **evidence** after an attack to see what happened.

## Task 3 - Defensive Security in Practice
Organizations use **Defence in Depth**. This means they build multiple **layers of defence** (like a castle) so that if one layer fails, others still protect the data.

### Defensive Layers:
1. **Employee Training:** Teaching staff to recognize **phishing** attempts.
2. **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** Acts like a **surveillance camera** for the network.
3. **Firewalls:** Acts like a **security guard** that blocks or allows traffic.
4. **Security Policies:** Rules like **strong passwords** that make it harder for attackers to get in.

### The Tools of the Trade:
* **SOC (Security Operations Centre):** A **24/7** command center where professionals monitor the organization.
* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Acts like a **radar**. it collects all data from the organization into one **central place** for quick analysis.

## Summary
* **Blue Teaming** is about protecting and defending.
* **Defence in Depth** ensures there is no single point of failure.
* The **SOC** and **SIEM** are essential for monitoring and responding to threats in real time.
