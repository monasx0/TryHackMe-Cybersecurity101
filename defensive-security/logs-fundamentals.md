# Logs Fundamentals

## Task 1 - Introduction to Logs
In the physical world, investigators use traces like footprints or CCTV footage to solve crimes. In the digital world, these traces are called **Logs**. Logs are the **digital footprints** left behind by every activity on a system. Whether an action is a routine task or a malicious attack, it is recorded, making it possible for security teams to perform **root cause analysis**.

### Key Use Cases for Logs:
* **Security Events Monitoring:** Detecting anomalous behavior in real-time.
* **Incident Investigation:** Providing a detailed trail of what occurred during a breach.
* **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing hardware or software errors.
* **Auditing and Compliance:** Establishing a record of activity to meet legal requirements.

## Task 2 - Categorization of Logs
To prevent investigators from being overwhelmed by data, logs are segregated into specific categories based on the information they provide:

| Log Type | Usage | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Logs** | Troubleshooting OS issues. | Startup/Shutdown, driver loads. |
| **Security Logs** | Investigating security incidents. | Logins, policy changes. |
| **Application Logs** | Monitoring specific software. | App errors, updates. |
| **Network Logs** | Troubleshooting traffic issues. | Firewall logs, connection events. |
| **Access Logs** | Tracking resource usage. | Web server or database access. |

## Task 3 - Windows Event Logs Analysis
Windows stores its logs in a structured format accessible via a utility called the **Event Viewer**. This tool provides a graphical interface to filter and search through millions of records.

### Crucial Windows Log Categories:
* **Application:** Records errors and warnings from software running on the OS.
* **System:** Records events generated by the Windows operating system itself (e.g., driver failures).
* **Security:** The most vital file for security professionals; it tracks authentication and account changes.

### Understanding Event IDs
Every activity in Windows has a unique **Event ID**. These are essential for rapid filtering:

| Event ID | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4624** | Successful Login |
| **4625** | Failed Login |
| **4720** | User Account Created |
| **4724** | Password Reset Attempt |
| **4726** | User Account Deleted |

## Task 4 - Web Server Access Logs Analysis
Every request made to a website—whether it is viewing a page or logging in—is recorded in an **Access Log**. For Apache servers, these are typically found in **/var/log/apache2/access.log**.

### Components of a Web Log Entry:
* **IP Address:** The source of the request.
* **Timestamp:** When the request occurred.
* **HTTP Method:** The action (e.g., **GET** to retrieve data, **POST** to send data).
* **Status Code:** The server's response (e.g., **200** for success, **404** for not found).

### Linux Command Line Analysis
Since web logs are often plain text, we use Linux utilities for manual analysis:

**Displaying Content:**
```bash
cat access.log
```
**Combining Files:**
```bash
cat access1.log access2.log > combined_access.log
```
**Searching for Specific Patterns (e.g., an IP):**
```bash
grep "192.168.1.1" access.log
```
**Paging Through Large Files:**
```bash
less access.log
```

## Task 5 - Conclusion
Logs are the ultimate source of truth in a digital investigation. By understanding how to categorize logs and use tools like **Event Viewer** or **grep**, security professionals can reconstruct an attacker's steps and secure the environment against future threats.
