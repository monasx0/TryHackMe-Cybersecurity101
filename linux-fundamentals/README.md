# Linux Fundamentals

Welcome to my Linux Fundamentals journey! This repository documents my progress through TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals Part 1, 2, and 3, where I learned the basics of using Linux for cybersecurity, system administration, and everyday computing.

Linux is a powerful operating system used widely in servers, cloud platforms, and security environments. Through this hands-on learning path, I explored command-line navigation, file management, networking basics, scripting, and system services, building a solid foundation for more advanced topics.
