# Training Impact on Teams
# Corporate Cyber Security Training: Strategy and ROI

## Task 1 - Understanding the Impact of Cyber Security Training
Mastering cyber security requires a combination of theory and diligent practice. Because security testing on production systems is dangerous, dedicated training platforms are essential for building skills without risking operational stability.

**Key Benefits of Continuous Training:**
* **Capacity Building:** Increases a team's efficiency without the need for additional headcount.
* **Incident Prevention:** Prepared teams detect threats faster, reducing the likelihood of a live breach.
* **Standardization:** Creates a common baseline for assessing skills, moving away from vague labels like "junior" or "senior."
* **Recruitment:** Makes it feasible to hire junior staff by providing a clear, accelerated ramp-up path.
* **Team Building:** Competitive training formats like Capture the Flag (CTF) foster collaboration and friendship.

## Task 2 - Cyber Security Training for Large Organisations
As teams scale beyond 20 members, off-the-shelf training often needs customization. Large organizations require platforms that can integrate into their existing enterprise ecosystem.

* **Content Customization:** Tools like "Content Studio" allow organizations to modify modules to focus on their specific infrastructure and priorities.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Large-scale solutions must support **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for security and provide well-documented **APIs** to connect with internal HR and management software.

## Task 3 - Write a Cyber Security Training Investment Proposal
To secure a training budget, it is often necessary to present a data-driven ROI (Return on Investment) calculation to management.

### Calculating the Financial Impact
Consider a team of 10 employees where training is estimated to increase productivity by a modest 4%:

| Variable | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Team Size** | 10 Employees |
| **Annual Salary per Employee** | $80,000 |
| **Total Annual Salary Cost** | $800,000 |
| **Productivity Gain (4%)** | **$32,000** |
| **Training Cost ($500/head)** | **$5,000** |

**The ROI Calculation:**
Using these figures, the ROI is calculated as follows:
$32,000 / $5,000 = 640%. 
As a percentage, $6.4 = 640%.

## Task 4 - Vendor Selection
Choosing the right training partner requires answering critical questions about the workforce and the platform's capabilities:

1.  **Audience Profile:** Who are we buying this for? Consider their current background and specific roles.
2.  **Breadth & Depth:** Does the vendor provide high-quality content for the specific topics relevant to our organization?
3.  **Unified Experience:** Can users learn theory, train in labs, and practice skills on a single, cohesive platform?
4.  **Vendor Reputation:** Does the provider have a proven track record with similar-sized organizations?

While the **CFO** focuses on the price tag, the primary value lies in the increased productivity of high-cost security personnel, which far outweighs the initial training investment.

## Task 5 - Conclusion
Training is a vital ingredient for organizational performance and employee retention. Whether through **TryHackMe Business** for corporate teams or **TryHackMe Classrooms** for educational institutions, structured learning environments accelerate the transition from junior to expert status. Lifelong learning is no longer a luxury in cyber security—it is a requirement.
